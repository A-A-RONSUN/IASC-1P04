## About the Game

BreakOut is a short adventure game where the player is a person who is good natured but had to go against the law for his family which causes him to be sent to a prison with terrible conditions. The only hope the player has is to either escape or survive so that they can return to their family safely no matter how much they change. The choices the player makes when either escaping or surviving will give them a different experience. This was inspired by the incident of Attica prison where the prisoners were treated inhumanely causing them to riot. BreakOut conveys the idea that people can change for the better or for the worse.
